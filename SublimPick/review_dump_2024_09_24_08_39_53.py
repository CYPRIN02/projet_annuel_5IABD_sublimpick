It has also helped with fading my stubborn melasma which has been an absolute beast to keep at bay.

Granted, it is a bit cost prohibitive but so well worth it that it has become a daily staple in my skincare arsenal. Love, love, love it! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. My one and only complaint is that the topper seems to come a bit loose after about 24 hours - May be of concern if traveling especially by air where you're not always in control of your luggage. All in all, a holy grail of a product in my book.", 'Bethany', '2018-11-15T00:00:00.000Z', 'True', '2', '1', '2024-09-24'),
