I don't (or at least didn't) have oily skin, uneven texture or large pores so I didn't need the line to treat anything, I just really liked the scent and was told the lactic acid would keep my skin clean an bright. The first few days of use, my skin felt amazing - super soft and some of the redness on my cheeks was gone. But after about a week of twice-daily use, my pores got VERY big... my cheeks looked like orange peels. I didn't understand this, as this line is made specifically for this issue? I didn't get oily (blotting papers confirmed this) but my pores were just stuck open. Perhaps it's a great line for people with oily skin, but my normal skin did not take to it. I'll keep it around to use once a week or so, but making it part of my daily regimen just isn't going to work for me.
